# Let's see how data activator works

## Goal: Imagine you work for logistics and want to monitor the delivery attempts for your drugs. You want to be alerted when a delivery failed more than once

## 1. Create a new reflex with the sample data

## 2. Create a new trigger and call it "Failed data deliveries" with delivery attempts

## 3. Create a data activator to receive an email every time there's more than 1 failure in the delivery attempt

Let it be an email.
Define the content including all relevant info.
